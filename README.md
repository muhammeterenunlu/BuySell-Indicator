# BuySell-Indicator

This script is designed to assist traders in making buy or sell decisions by analyzing the trend and generating buy/sell alerts. The indicator is developed for platforms like Trading View and is written in Pine Script language.

Main Components:

1. Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA) on Heikin Ashi Close:
   - TEMA is an enhanced form of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) which reduces the lag.
   - Heikin Ashi Close is calculated as an average of open, high, low, and close prices, which provides smoother price data.
   - Two TEMA sets are calculated (TMA1 & TMA2, TMA3 & TMA4). 
   - RAHZ and RAHZ1 are differences between these TEMA sets.
   - EREN and EREN1 are the respective sums.

2. Plotting and Highlighting Trends:
   - The trend is identified based on the comparison of EREN1 (green) and EREN (red). If green is greater than red, it implies an upward trend and vice versa.
   - Trend regions are filled: green for upward and red for downward trends.

3. Buy/Sell Conditions and Alerts:
   - A buy condition (`longCond`) is met when the green line overtakes the red line from below. 
   - A sell condition (`shortCond`) is met when the green line falls below the red line from above.
   - Alerts are created for both conditions: a "BUY ALARM" when the buy condition is met and a "SELL ALARM" for the sell condition.

4. Visualization of Buy/Sell Signals:
   - Buy signals are represented as green upward-pointing triangles below the price bar.
   - Sell signals are represented as red downward-pointing triangles above the price bar.

5. Simple Exponential Moving Average (EMA):
   - A standard EMA is plotted in blue as a baseline trend indicator.

Concise Summary:
The "Rahz BuySell" indicator uses a Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA) on Heikin Ashi Close to determine market trends. The trend is highlighted in green for upward and red for downward. Buy and sell signals are generated based on the crossover of two trend lines, with visual markers (triangles) and alerts for traders. Additionally, a blue EMA line is plotted for reference.
